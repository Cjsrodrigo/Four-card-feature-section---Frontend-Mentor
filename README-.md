## My process

As the challenge being my first approach on CSS grid and mobile-first, it was fun to learn new techniques and apply then the best way possible, had to take a break to learn grid princicples, but I'm 100% proud and satisfeied with my work.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive layouts

### What I learned

Learning a mobile-first approach was super usefull.

### Continued development

Speaking on a front-end/WEB basis, I'm very confortable working with HTML & CSS, and feeling that I can apply it to any challenge that comes on my way.
JS is the next step, going to make to do my best to learn it's best practices and master it!

Of course JS frameworks are also on my plan, like React/React Native, Typescript, but I feel like the best thing to do for now is to have a good base and knowledge in JS.

IOS development/Swift is a must!
